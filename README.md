> National Data Science Competition 2020 (NDSC) is the largest online data science competition in Indonesia. In this competition, the registered team should finish product matching tasks based on images and title dataset. My team and I focused on the image only due to many noise in the title dataset (i.e. we've found that there are similar titles for different images). To employ image processing, we propose the use of pretrained model, VGG16, and the SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform). On one hand, the VGG16 is performed to extract the value of similarity between two images. On the other hand, the SIFT score is used to detect number of edges and ratio score between two images.

> Further detail about SIFT algorithm can be found [here](https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_feature2d/py_sift_intro/py_sift_intro.html). For VGG16 can be read [here](https://medium.com/@jeff.lee.1990710/image-similarity-using-vgg16-transfer-learning-and-cosine-similarity-98571d8055e3).
